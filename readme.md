Dev.php
=======

Helpers for PHP dev.  Currently, only provides `TJM\Dev::dump()` and `TJM\Dev::getDump()` to output and get a string result of `var_dump()` or `dump()`.  However, when passed a class name or callable that is user defined, it will output the file with line numbers where that class or callable is defined and its definition from that file.
